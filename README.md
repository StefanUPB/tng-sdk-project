# tng-sdk-project

This repository contains the `tng-sdk-project` component that is part of the European H2020 project [5GTANGO](http://www.5gtango.eu) NFV SDK. This component is responsible to manage network service workspaces and projects on the developer's machine.

The seed code of this component is based on the `son-cli` toolbox that was developed as part of the European H2020 project [SONATA](http://sonata-nfv.eu).

## Installation

```bash
$ python setup.py install
```

## Usage

To start working, you need a workspace that holds your configuration files. The default location is `~/.tng-workspace/`, but it may be at any location and there can also be multiple workspaces.

```bash
$ tng-workspace       # initializes a new workspace at the default location
$ tng-workspace --workspace path/to/workspace     # inits a workspace at a custom location
```

Once you have a workspace, you can create projects with the `tng-project` command. You can also add or remove files from the project (wildcards allowed).

```bash
$ tng-project -p path/to/project                # creates a new project at the specified path
$ tng-project -p path/to/project --add file1    # adds file1 to the project.yml
$ tng-project -p path/to/project --add file1 --type text/plain  # adds file1 with explicit MIME type
$ tng-project -p path/to/project --remove file1 # removes file1 from the project.yml
```

The `--workspace` option allows to specify a workspace at a custom location. Otherwise, the workspace at the default location is used.
For both `tng-workspace` and `tng-project` the option `--debug` makes the output more verbose.
